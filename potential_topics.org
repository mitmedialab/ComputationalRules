* Adaptive Governance Topics

** Example Contexts
*** Managing common-pool resources
    * Water Rights
    * Game & Wildlife Population
      * Fisheries

*** Intent-Matching 
    * Offer Networks:
      * AI market-making based on asserted (and potentially inferred) intents. This is similar to kidney networks where donor-types and recipients don't always match, except here there are chains of different offers and requests. Offernetworks.
      * balanced with perceived global health of the network by competing heterogeneous objective (functions), whose fitness is augmented by human input and interaction and other sensors/signals (the hypothesis here is that a singular objective function (make more $, increase production), without regard to external feedback leads to pathological structure)
*** Adaptive Cities
*** Automated Indoor Food Production
*** Transportation
*** Logistics & Distribution
*** Crowd-Sourced Constitution/Laws?

*** Adaptive Health-Care: Beyond Insurance and Social Security

* Approaches
  * Formal Logics (Rule-Based)
    * Knowledge Representation (KR)
    * Semantic Knowledge Graphs
    * advantage: starts with a formal language that a machine can process and which can be made understandable to a human (RDF, JSON-LD)
    * Linked Opend Data
      - [[http://lodlaundromat.org/][LOD Laundromat]]:
        Access to /all/ linked open data and data cleaning
      - [[https://json-ld.org/][JSON-LD - JSON for Linking Data]]
      - [[http://rdfa.info/]]
  * Statistical Models & Methods
    * Machine Learning Techniques
      * advantage: 
        - statistical methods are proving promising to scale
      * disadvantage:
        - needs a lot of data and processing power
        - not always clear how we got to final output
        - bias in data is reflected in output
        - results highly correlated/coupled with dataset learned on
        - cannot compose semantically with other system

* Buildable Options
  - (eg: open source software, available API's and other services, other options, etc)
